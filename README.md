## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [+] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [+] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [+] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [+] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [+] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [+] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [+] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [+] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [+] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [+] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [+] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [+] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [+] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

https://teropa.info/blog/2016/08/10/frequency-and-pitch.html 
https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.asp 
I used these websites for finding the font and color selections for my game. I also used a frequency pitch toner to select which pitches that I wanted for my game. Also breif research and youtube videos helped in adding extra features to my game.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)

One challenge that I had run into early was getting the buttons to change colors as well as also making sure that they functioned correctly while being pressed. I had to run through the program again by checking each file and making sure that I had input everything in correctly, only to circle back again to see that I had made one of the button variables uppercase when it was already in lowercase format throughout my files. This happened a couple times when I was trying to get my game to work and was in the final stages of bringing the whole thing together. I also had difficulty implementing some of the optional features as they challenged me in a way to use what I had just learned to develop a system that would make these features run parallel with the whole light game. Adding the ticking clock that counted down the time remaining was a challenge because I could not get it to run for a vast majority of time and I was only able to get the clock to appear as opposed to counting down. I eventually noticed that I had named the variable for my “TimeLeft” function something different on my html file. Combining this with having the timer end the game was a difficulty that I ran into while working on my project. Speeding up the time in which the buttons flashes was a bit of a curve ball for me as well because the game had got to a point where the flashes weren’t even visible so I had to do some critiquing to make sure I got rid of that bug.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

A question that I had throughout this experience and something I began to wonder was can each of the different systems (i.e HTML, CSS, Javascript) be used for their own individual entities? By this I mean could this project have been done in a way where only one of these were being used or where even just one of them was excluded from the making of the game. I am relatively new to these types of databases so I’m starting to learn more about them as I go along but another question that had come to mind was what would be the advantages to using systems like java as opposed to python or c++? Would they be more beneficial depending on the project type, such as this one?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

I would definitely spend a good amount of time adding features to my project to see how advanced I could possibly make it. The continuous development of something is an interest that I carry and being able to maximize the output of the game would be something that I found cool and intriguing to take place in. Enhancing this system to the point where I could possibly get it to function as a phone application and just toggling with those types of things is something that I would spend the extra time doing. Even being able to implement features that I didn’t get too such as leaving a remaining amount of lives or inserting an image over the buttons to make them visible to the user.
